# Incremental Miner Experiment Plots

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for generating and analyzing plots
related to incremental rule mining experiments. The notebook, `plots.ipynb`,
provides visualizations and insights derived from the experimental
results of an incremental mining algorithm.

## Repository Structure

- **`plots.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook for data visualization. It
processes experimental results and generates plots to illustrate key findings.
- **`plots.py`**: An exported Python script for generating plots
                non-interactively.
- **`plots/`**: Directory for saving the plots generated by
                           the notebook.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed on your system:

- Python (>= 3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries:
  - `matplotlib`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`

## Update data

Update the `.xlsx` filename in the first cell of the notebook to point to your
new data file.
